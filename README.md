Caching System
The app implements intelligent caching to reduce API calls:

Weather data cached for 5 minutes
Forecast data cached for 5 minutes
Manual cache clearing available
Cache statistics in user dashboard
🛠️ Configuration
Changing Login Credentials
Edit app.py:

VALID_USERNAME = "your_username"
VALID_PASSWORD_HASH = generate_password_hash("your_password")
Adjusting Cache Duration
Edit app.py:

CACHE_DURATION = 300  # Change to desired seconds
Search History Limit
Edit app.py:

history = history[:15]  # Change 15 to desired limit
🔒 Security Features
Password hashing using Werkzeug's security module
Session-based authentication
Unauthorized access prevention
API key protection via environment variables
CSRF protection through session tokens
🐛 Troubleshooting
"City not found" error
Verify the city name spelling
Try using the full city name or add country code
Example: "London,UK" instead of just "London"
API key errors
Ensure your API keys are correctly set in api.env
Verify your API keys are active on respective platforms
Check you haven't exceeded API rate limits
Application won't start
Verify all dependencies are installed: pip install -r requirements.txt
Check Python version is 3.7 or higher
Ensure port 5000 is not already in use
📊 API Rate Limits
OpenWeatherMap Free Tier:

60 calls/minute
1,000,000 calls/month
Unsplash Free Tier:

50 requests/hour
The app's caching system helps stay within these limits.

🚀 Deployment
For production deployment:

Set a strong secret key:
app.secret_key = 'your-strong-random-secret-key'
Disable debug mode:
app.run(debug=False)
Use a production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn):
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn app:app
Consider using environment variables for all sensitive data
